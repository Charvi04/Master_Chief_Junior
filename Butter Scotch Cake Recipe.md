##  <u>**Instructions**</u>

###  For The Cake Base

**1.** Preheat the oven to 350 F , position the rack in the middle of the oven. Grease a  7-inch cake tin with little butter and dust with flour to coat the pan, or you may use parchment paper.

**2.** In the medium mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Add salt, whisk the dry ingredients until well-combined. Set aside.

**3.** In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted  with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and creamy, scraping down in between, should take about  2-3 minutes. Or you can use electric hand mixer/beater.

**4.** Add in the eggs next, one at a time, continue beating on medium-high speed.

**5.** In goes the butterscotch essence, followed by butterscotch syrup. Continue mixing on medium speed.

**6.** Now reduce to the lowest possible speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and milk, starting with flour and ending with flour. ( DO NOT OVER MIX). Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tin.

**7.** Bake in the middle rack, for about 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the  cake comes out clean. Cool the cake on the rack in the tin for 15 minutes, then remove from the tin and cool on the rack completely.

###  For The Praline Preparation

**1.** Whilst the cake is baking, you can prepare the butterscotch. Take  the sugar and water in heavy bottomed  saucepan, switched on medium heat. Do not stir. Let the sugar start melting.

**2.** Once the sugar starts bubbling, keep swirling the pan, until the sugar begins to caramelize and turn a nice amber color.

**3.** Switch off the heat, ad in butter and cashew nuts. Mix well until the butter has incorporated well in the caramel.

**4.** Transfer to the preparing baking sheet, and spread it quickly and evenly.

Let it cool ( be careful as it is very hot and it may take 15-30 minutes to cool).

**5.** Once it has cooled, beak roughly into pieces.

**6.** Transfer to zip lock bag and  crush roughly with a rolling pin or put it in a mixer and pulse a few times to crumble it down. It's ready to use as a topping for the cakes, ice-creams or anything you wish. Store in a air tight container in the refrigerator. Use as required.

###  For The Whipped Cream Frosting

**1.** In a small saucepan, add gelatin with cold water; let it stank until thickens. Place over low heat, stirring  constantly, just until the egg dissolves.

**2.** Remove from heat and let it cool, make sure it doesn't set.

**3.** In  the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk  attachment, add the cream, icing sugar, butterscotch essence and yellow food color.

**4.** Whip the cream with the sifted icing sugar,  until slightly thick.

**5.** While slowly beating, add the gelatin to whipped cream.

**6.** Whip at high speed until it forms high peak. Do not over beat or else it will turn into butter. Another method to check if your cream is ready is by inverting bowl if the cream stays intact without showing signs of slipping from the bowl, it's done. Transfer the cream to a  zip lock bag. Refrigerate the cream in the mean while. Sniff off the edge when you are already to use.

### Assembling The Cake

**1.** Once the cake has completed cooled down, divide it into three layers with the help  of long serrated knife.

**2.** Brush each layer with syrup.

**3.** Pipe out whipped cream in circular motions starting  from the outer circumference towards the center. Flatten and smooth the cream with a offset spatula.

**4.** Sprinkler two table spoons of butterscotch granules and 1 table spoon butterscotch syrup on two layers.

**5.** Finally assemble  the layers on a platter that you can rotate, for easier frosting (Simply put a bowl and flat plate, and assemble all the layers over it). Finally, place the last cake layer, and coat the cake with a  rough crumb coating. Refrigerate it for 30 minutes.

**6.** Finally, frost the cake, smooth out edges. Sprinkler some more butterscotch on the top of the cake and the sides. You will require approx 3/4 cup of butterscotch granules. You can add more or less as desire. Refrigerate the cake for 2-3 hours before serving. You can drizzle some more butterscotch syrup before serving !
